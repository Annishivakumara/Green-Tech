## 💡 Introduction

### Problem Statement

The growing crisis of e-waste refers to the rapid increase in discarded electronic devices, which contain hazardous materials and pose significant environmental and health risks if not properly managed. This crisis is driven by factors such as rapid technological advancements, increased consumption of electronics, and shorter device lifespans.

### Solution

Green Tech Renew tackles the e-waste crisis by:

- Educating users on responsible disposal.
- Providing a recycling locator with pickup scheduling.
- Building trust through recycler verification and potential e-waste tracking.
- Promoting reuse and repair via a marketplace and repair shop directory.
- Incentivizing responsible disposal with rewards or gamification.

The app fosters a circular economy for electronics by connecting consumers, recyclers, and repair shops, ultimately minimizing e-waste's environmental impact.

## 🎯 Our Target SDG Goals

![SDG Goals](sdg-image-link)

Green Tech Renew is an Android app that aims to reduce e-waste by promoting responsible recycling, raising awareness about e-waste dangers, and facilitating electronics reuse and repair. Our key objectives include:

- Increasing app users and engagement.
- Building a community around responsible disposal.
- Partnering with stakeholders to maximize impact.

### 📜 Description

The e-waste crisis is a global problem caused by an increase in discarded electronics. These devices contain hazardous substances such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which, if improperly handled, can contaminate soil and water, harming ecosystems and human health.

Factors contributing to the crisis include:

- Rapid technological advancements and shorter device lifespans.
- A culture of constant upgrading.
- Insufficient recycling infrastructure, leading to unsafe disposal methods like open-air burning, which releases toxic pollutants.
- Loss of valuable resources like precious metals when e-waste isn't properly recycled.
- Disproportionate impact on developing nations where e-waste is processed under hazardous conditions.

Addressing this crisis requires a multi-pronged approach, including sustainable design, extended producer responsibility, improved recycling technologies, consumer education, and international cooperation.
